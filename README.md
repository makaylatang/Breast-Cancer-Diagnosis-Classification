# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-Classification

For this analysis, we conduct binary classification on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, which is stored in the wdbc.data csv file. The dataset contains information about the characteristics of cell nuclei in n images, each of which has multiple attributes that are explained in wdbc.names. Our goal is to predict the diagnosis attribute, denoted by outcome Y and located in column 2 of the dataset, which indicates whether the cell is malignant (M) or benign (B).

> 📂 Dataset:
  - Sample size: 569
  - Number of observations in each class: M = 212; B = 357
  - Number of attributes: 32 (ID, diagnosis, 30 real-valued input features)

### 📈 Models
  - Logistic Regression
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis Model
  - Quadratic Discriminant Analysis Model
  - KNN Classifier
  - Ridge Regression
  - LASSO Regression
  
### 📝 Evaluation
  - Compute the prediction accuracy (based on the original data)
  - Plot the ROC curve, computed on the test set
  - Compute an estimate of the Area under the ROC (AUC)
